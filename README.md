<h1>Fluent-Implementation</h1>
<br>
<p>In this Project , we have intregated the Elastic search to analyse,search and visualize the log </p>
<p>We have Used FluentD to push the data to log data to elastic search .
<br>
Fluentd is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data.</p>
<p>we have also done Aspect-oriented programming(AOP) to seperate cross cutting concern.where we have used custom annotation to implement the AOP</p>
